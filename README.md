# NSW Bond Cheatsheet

This is the source code for the NSW Bond Cheatsheet site. The site was built using the [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework), and the data for visualisations was sourced from the Fair Trading [rental bond data site](https://www.nsw.gov.au/housing-and-construction/rental-forms-surveys-and-data/rental-bond-data).

This site was written for the purpose of:
1. helping renters in NSW keep their bond
2. providing greater transparency of Rental Bonds Online data
