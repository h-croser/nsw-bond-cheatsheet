# NSW Bond Cheatsheet

This is the source code for the NSW Bond Cheatsheet site. The site was built using the [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com), and the data for visualisations was sourced from the Fair Trading [rental bond data site](https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/about-fair-trading/rental-bond-data).

This site was written for the purpose of:
1. informing renters in NSW of their tenancy rights - succinctly, not exhaustively
2. providing visualisations of Rental Bonds Online data for greater transparency
