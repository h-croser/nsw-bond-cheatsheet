# Guide to keeping your bond

Below are some steps you should take to ensure you keep your bond.

## At the start and end of the tenancy

<details>

<summary><strong>Don't give money directly to your landlord/agent. Keep it safe with Rental Bonds Online.</strong></summary>

Register your bond with [Rental Bonds Online (RBO)](https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/housing-and-property/renting/rental-bonds-online, "Rental Bonds Online"), a service offered by NSW Fair Trading.<br>
RBO stores your bond money in escrow so that your landlord can only take your bond if a formal claim has been made (which you can contest).

If you give bond money directly to your landlord/agent legally your bond rights still apply, but it is much easier for them to unlawfully take your bond.<br>
If you are asked for a cash bond, you should instead suggest using RBO. A landlord/agent refusing to lodge bond through RBO should be treated with suspicion and ideally avoided.

<summary><strong>Obtain an accurate in-going and out-going condition report.</strong></summary>

A condition report is a document that states the condition of the property's features at the beginning and end of the tenancy, as seen by tenant and landlord/agent. The condition report form can be found [here](https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/help-centre/forms#Residentialtenancyforms).

Condition reports are a requirement for tenancies and form an important piece of evidence in many bond disputes.<br>
It's important that you carefully review the landlord/agent's report and disagree/comment where necessary.

<summary><strong>Take photos of everything.</strong></summary>

Photos are an important piece of evidence in many bond disputes, and you should always take photos at the start and end of the tenancy. Here are some tips for taking photos of the property:

- Take the photos before moving in and after moving out. Furniture can obscure walls and surfaces, so it's good to take the photos when the property is empty.
- Take photos of _everything_. For each room, take a photo of each wall, the floor and ceiling. Also take a close-up photo of any fittings like light switches, powerpoints, and taps.
- Add a date-stamp to the photos if you can. The date a photo was taken can be significant in a bond dispute, and it is much easier if the date is stamped on the photo itself.

<summary><strong>Attend the final inspection.</strong></summary>

The final inspection is a walk-through of the property by the landlord/agent to ensure the property is left in a similar condition to when the tenancy began.<br>
The out-going condition report should be filled based on the final inspection. Ideally, your photos of the property will be taken on the same date as the final inspection, or as close to it as possible.<br>
The property should be empty and clean by the final inspection.<br>
**Note:** there is no obligation to have the property professionally cleaned, unless otherwise stated in the lease agreement. The standard expectation is for the property to be as clean as it was at the beginning of the tenancy, with reasonable wear and tear.

The landlord/agent must give you an opportunity to attend the final inspection - and you should attend.<br>
By the end of the final inspection, the landlord/agent should either accept the property in its condition or identify the damage they believe the property has sustained.<br>

<summary><strong>Claim your bond back proactively.</strong></summary>

The bond claim can be submitted through [RBO](https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/housing-and-property/renting/rental-bonds-online, "Rental Bonds Online") by either the tenant or the landlord/agent.

- If the landlord/agent doesn't identify any damage, you should claim the entire bond through RBO as soon as the final inspection is complete. It is reasonable and correct to claim the bond back if the landlord/agent cannot identify claimable damage during the final inspection.<br>
- If the landlord/agent states that there is damage and/or cause to withhold bond, or if they are unsure and will "get back to you", urge them to identify the damage and be specific. It _is_ reasonable for the landlord/agent to not know the cost of the damage (as this must be quoted by professionals), but it _isn't_ reasonable for them to refuse to identify the damage itself.

You should ensure you've had a conversation with the landlord/agent before submitting the bond claim.<br>
If there is a disagreement, you should make an effort to resolve it. If the disagreement cannot be resolved, you should claim the portion of the bond that you think is fair.

## Throughout the tenancy

<details>

<summary><strong>Communicate in writing wherever possible</strong></summary>

Communications throughout the tenancy can be important evidence during a bond dispute. Emails are ideal, as they automatically record date, time, and recipients, and they are also stored on a searchable server.<br>
If communication is done verbally, you should follow up with an email to the landlord/agent confirming the notable things discussed. **Note:** NSW law requires that both parties consent to an audio recording of a conversation.
